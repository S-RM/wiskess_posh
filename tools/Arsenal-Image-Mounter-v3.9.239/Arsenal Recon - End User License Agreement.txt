US Government Agencies Bound By Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations. APPLICABLE FLOWDOWNS OF THE PRIME CONTRACT. H.11.3 GSAM 552.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (FAR Deviation) (July 2015). (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101) that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the commercial supplier agreement. If the commercial supplier agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the commercial supplier agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute or applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) H.11.4 GSAM 552.232-78 Commercial Supplier Agreements – Unenforceable Clauses (a) When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a commercial supplier agreement, the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the commercial supplier agreement. As used herein, “this agreement” means the commercial supplier agreement: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the licensee/customer is an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply: (i) Applicability. This agreement is part of a contract between the commercial supplier (or the licensor, where the commercial supplier agreement contains a license) and the U.S. Government for the acquisition of the supply or service 6 (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR Parts 13, 14 or 15). (ii) Licensee or Customer. This agreement shall bind the ordering activity as licensee or customer but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity. (iii) Law and disputes. This agreement is governed by Federal law. (A) Any provision purporting to subject the U.S. Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted. (B) Any provision requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted. (C) Any provision prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted. (iv) Continued performance. In accordance with subparagraph (i) of the clause at 52.233-1 (Disputes), this agreement may not be unilaterally terminated by the commercial supplier or licensor, and the provision of supplies or services under this agreement may not be unilaterally suspended unless generally withdrawn from the commercial market. If the supplier or licensor believes the ordering activity to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in such subparagraph (i). (v) Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief. In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, (A) binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and (B) equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the U.S. Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act). (vi) No additional terms. No other commercial supplier terms shall bind the Government unless included verbatim (not by reference) in the commercial supplier agreement and added to the Government contract or order with the approval of the cognizant contracting officer. (vii) No unilateral changes. Any clause of this agreement claiming that one party to the agreement may unilaterally change any provision of this agreement shall not apply. (viii) No automatic renewals. If any license or service tied to periodic payment is provided under this agreement (e.g., annual software maintenance or annual lease term), such license or service shall not renew automatically upon expiration of its current term without prior express Government approval. (ix) Indemnification. Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that representation in the conduct of litigation in which the United States is a party or is interested is reserved for the U.S. Department of Justice in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516. (x) Audits. Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user’s compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows: (A) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the ordering activity. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order. (B) This charge, if disputed by the ordering activity, will be resolved through the Disputes clause at 52.233-1; no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the ordering activity until the conclusion of the dispute process. (C) Any audit requested by the commercial supplier or licensor will be performed at the commercial supplier’s or licensor’s expense, without reimbursement by the Government. (xi) Taxes or surcharges. Any taxes or surcharges which the commercial supplier or licensor seeks to pass along to the Government as end user will be governed by the terms of the underlying Government contract or order and, in any event, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for a determination of applicability prior to invoicing. (xii) Non-assignment. This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under the clause at 52.232-23, Assignment of Claims. (xiii) Confidential information. If this agreement includes a confidentiality clause, such clause is hereby amended to state that (A) neither this agreement nor the final pricing agreed to by the ordering activity in the underlying Government contract or order shall be deemed "confidential information" 8 notwithstanding marking to that effect; and (B) notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the Government may retain any confidential information as required by law, regulation or its bona fide internal document retention procedures for legal, regulatory or compliance purposes; provided, however, that all such retained confidential information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this agreement. (b) If any provision of this agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the preceding subparagraph (a)(1), the provisions of subparagraph (a)(1) shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.
